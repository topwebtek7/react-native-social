# React Native Social

This app is a starting point for a social app built in React Native. It contains
a simple server in `server/` and the start of a react-native client in
`client/`.

Please update the app to add the following features:

- For post items with media content include the first image in the list inline
  within post, just above the body text.
- For `type: "poll"` posts build a simple poll display showing the results of
  the poll. You can use twitter polls as a guide.

## Getting Started

Before running the app you will need to start the server.

    cd server/
    yarn install
    yarn build
    yarn start

Then you should be able to launch the react native app and make the requested
updates.

Good luck!
